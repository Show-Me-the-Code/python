Last night, my parents told me that they would go to have dinner with friends, so they wouldn’t stay at home and let me to buy something to eat by myself. I played computer games for a long time and when I got tired, I found it was almost eight o’clock. I didn’t want to go out, so I opened the fridge, there were many stuffs for me to make dinner. I had never done it before, I only watched my mother cook, but I still wanted to try. I made a fire and put the meat in the pan, the flavors were also mixed in it. When the meat almost got black, I finished. Whe I tasted, I realized the meat was over cooked. I must learn to cook.
