People will make a lot of friends during their lifetime, the more friends they make, the more capable they are. Some young people are proud of having many friends, but only the true friends deserve us to care about. The person we make must be positive to life. He will set the good example to you and help you to be a better man. The bad friends will make you perverted, especially for the teenagers, they can’t make the right judgement and are easy to follow others, so the friends are very important part of their lives. Once they make the wrong friends, they will do the bad thing. So we don’t need more friends, just the right one.
