Hi, she's Dania. She's an architect. She usually wakes up at 6:00 a.m. Then she takes a shower, later she has breakfast with her sister Camila. After that, she goes to work by car. She doesn't like traffic. She finishes work at 5:00 pm. Later, she goes back home. She has dinner with her family. She watches her favorite T.V program, and finally she goes to bed at 11:00  pm.
See you:D
