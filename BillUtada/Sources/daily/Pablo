Hi. He’s Pablo. He is a student.
 Every week gets up at 6:30 am. Later he has a breakfast. He goes to school, later at three he goes back   home and has a lunch, always he does homework. He never watches Tv because doesn’t like. He takes a shower, later he has a dinner with your family and finally he goes to sleep at 10 pm.

On Saturday and Sunday, he usually gets up at 10 am, later he has a breakfast, later he goes to play soccer. He takes a shower, later   has a lunch, later he plays video games. He usually  goes a parties  with your friends and finally he goes to sleep at midnight. 
Good bye.
