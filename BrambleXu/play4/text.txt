This module implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Pythonâ€™s general purpose built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple.

In addition to the concrete container classes, the collections module provides abstract base classes that can be used to test whether a class provides a particular interface, for example, whether it is hashable or a mapping.

In some ways, the United States has made some progress. Fires no longer destroy 18,000 buildings as they did in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, or kill half a town of 2,400 people, as they did the same night in Peshtigo, Wisconsin. Other than the Beverly Hill Supper Club fire in Kentucky in 1977, it has been four decades since more than 100 Americans died in a fire.

But even with such successes, the United States still has one of the worst fire death rates in the world. Safety experts say the problem is neither money nor technology, but the indifference of a country that just will not take fires seriously enough.
