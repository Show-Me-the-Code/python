Being lost can offer you freedom. You identify your core values, desires, and tastes. You are open with yourself and you can try new things. You understand that you do not have to always rely on your partner. Perhaps there is a movie coming out this weekend, you can buy a ticket and go to the cinemas yourself — something that may have been unheard of for you in the past. Being forced to find this independence can make you a stronger person.
You can disconnect. You are no longer driven by the interests of your partner, but by your own desires. This means getting back to the basics, like reading books by your favorite author, exercising, eating your favorite meals. When you return to these ideals, you are strengthened and become a better you.

People think that being lost in a relationship signals doom for that relationship — it doesn’t. It all depends on how you manage this necessary stage and work towards making the most of it.
