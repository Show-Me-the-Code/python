The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret,
and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.
 They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.
 Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;

 husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.
 The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street.
 The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him.
 This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that
