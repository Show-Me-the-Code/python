Tesla¡¯s latest battle in its war to sell vehicles directly to customers ended in victory.

The American electric car manufacturer will be allowed to sell its products without franchised dealers in Maryland. A new bill passed by the state legislature will allow Tesla up to four stores that it will be allowed to sell cars directly to customers. Previously, Maryland law prohibited Tesla from selling directly to customers in its stores.

Earlier this month, West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin signed legislation that blocks Tesla from selling its vehicles in the state. The news that Tesla will be allowed to sell cars later this year in Maryland means that the company is still barred from selling cars in five states: Texas, Indiana, Michigan, Arizona and new West Virginia.
Tesla is currently working to launch its Model X crossover, which shares its platform with the Model S sedan.
