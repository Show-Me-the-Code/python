 China's Three Gorges project celebrated its 20th anniversary Sunday with a record high throughput of its five-tier ship lock.
The throughput of the year 2014 is expected to reach a record 110 million tonnes and the total throughput since the lock started operation in 2003 reached 700 million tonnes.
In the first six months, the throughput through the project's ship lock reached 55.69 million tonnes, an increase of 11.35 percent year on year, said the Three Gorges Navigation Administration.
The throughput of passengers also grew 54 percent to reach 191,400, said the administration.
The top three categories of cargo were mining materials, ore and containers.
The Three Gorges project is a multi-functional water control system, consisting of a 2,309-meter-long and 185-meter-high dam, a five-tier ship lock and 26 hydropower turbo-generators.
The project generates electricity, controls floods by storing excess water and helps to regulate the river's shipping capacity.
